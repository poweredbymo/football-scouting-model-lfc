# Scouting Similar Football Players Using Machine Learning

**Solving Real-World Problems: Who Can Replace Mohamed Salah?**



## Project Overview

This project tackles a real challenge faced by Liverpool FC during the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations: finding a replacement for Mohamed Salah while he represents Egypt. Using the FIFA 22 dataset and machine learning, I built a player recommendation system that identifies the most similar players based on 30+ performance attributes.

**Key Finding:** The model identified **Raphinha** as the ideal replacement which matched real-world transfer rumors reported by The Athletic and ESPN. Additionally in 2025, Raphinha went on to carry Barcelona to a title and become a world-class output machine, validating this project's results.

## Business Problem

- **Context**: Liverpool loses 3 key African players (including Salah) to AFCON in January
- **Impact**: 6 crucial matches across 3 competitions during their absence
- **Challenge**: Salah had 23 goals + 10 assists, how do you replace that?
- **Solution**: Data-driven player scouting using similarity algorithms

---

## Technical Approach

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
- Started with 16,710 players and 65 variables
- Applied domain knowledge to filter realistic targets:
  - Age < 29 (Liverpool's transfer strategy)
  - Contract ending before 2026 (availability)
  - Value < £102M (Salah's market value)
  - Wages > £50K (quality threshold)
  - Excluded rival clubs (Man City, Chelsea, etc.)
- Final dataset: **1,606 players, 48 variables**

### 2. **Similarity Models**

#### **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ⭐ Primary Model
- Calculated euclidean distance across 32 player attributes
- Ranked top 10 most similar players
- **Results validated by ESPN**: 2 of top 3 recommendations matched their expert analysis

#### **K-Means Clustering** (Secondary)
- Unsupervised grouping into 8 clusters
- Cross-validated KNN results
- 40% overlap with KNN recommendations


## Key Findings

### Top 5 Similar Players to Salah:

| Rank | Player | Club | Overall | Value | Key Strengths |
|------|--------|------|---------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | **Raphinha** | Leeds United | 82 | £46M | Speed (91), Stamina (84) |
| 2 | Oyarzabal | Real Sociedad | 85 | £77.5M | Versatility, Vision |
| 3 | Paulo Dybala | Juventus | 87 | £93M | Ball Control (93), Agility (92) |
| 4 | Y. Carrasco | Atlético Madrid | 84 | £45M | Pace (88), Dribbling (88) |
| 5 | L. Sané | Bayern Munich | 84 | £56M | Speed, Creativity |

### Model Validation
- **66.7% accuracy** compared to ESPN's expert-curated shortlist
- **Raphinha** identified as #1 target → Confirmed by The Athletic transfer news
- KNN outperformed K-Means for ranking similarity

## Visualizations

The notebook includes:
- **Polar charts** comparing player attributes
- **Distribution analysis** of player ratings
- **Correlation heatmaps** (discovered Reactions ↔ Overall = 0.88)
- **Interactive Plotly tables** for attribute comparison
- **Cluster visualization** using PCA dimensionality reduction

python 3.8+
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib
plotly
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository

## Methodology 

### Why KNN Over K-Means?
1. **Supervised vs Unsupervised**: KNN provides ranked similarity scores
2. **Interpretability**: Distance metrics directly show "how similar"
3. **Validation**: Can be compared against expert opinions (ESPN, The Athletic)

### Feature Engineering Insights
- **Correlation Discovery**: Reactions highly correlate with Overall (0.88)
- **Position Encoding**: Grouped 14 positions into Defender/Midfielder/Forward
- **Temporal Features**: Contract duration impacts transfer feasibility
- **Domain Filters**: Applied football industry knowledge (age, wages, rivals)

---

## Results & Impact

### Model Performance
- Successfully identified 2/3 of ESPN's expert recommendations
- Predicted Raphinha as top target which was confirmed by transfer news. Raphinha also went on to carry Barcelona to a title in 2025 and become a world-class output machine, validating the model's recommendations. 
- Excluded unrealistic options (goalkeepers, defenders)

### Business Value
- **Cost Efficiency**: Raphinha (£46M) vs alternatives (£56M-£93M)
- **Risk Reduction**: Data-driven vs gut-feeling recruitment
- **Scalability**: Model can be reused for any player across any position

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Incorporate real-time match data (not just FIFA ratings)
- [ ] Add injury history and availability analysis
- [ ] Weight attributes based on Liverpool's tactical system
- [ ] Build interactive web app for live player comparisons
- [ ] Integrate transfer market dynamics (agent fees, wages)
